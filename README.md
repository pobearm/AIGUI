# AIGUI
New idea about AI draw UI directly, skip coding.

# Why this project
When researching AI technology, I found that many projects focus on how to make AI replace humans in writing code This reminds me of another thing, people are developing robots that can accompany children to play, so that parents can work with peace of mind. Why not let robots work instead of allowing parents to have more time to accompany their children? This is completely inhumane So, I'm wondering why we can't let AI directly drive the graphics engine to draw the UI we need and present it directly on the screen? And does it have to generate some kind of code? So I drew down this idea.


# Next
I will study the technical feasibility of AI directly driving drawing engines.
